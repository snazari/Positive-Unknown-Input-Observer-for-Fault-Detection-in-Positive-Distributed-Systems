abstract ={A common theme in analysis and evaluation of network-based critical infrastructure is the assessment of system vulnerability. Graph theoretic, simulation, and optimization-based techniques have played a significant role in examining potential network vulnerabilities given the insights they can provide for mitigating facility loss and prioritizing fortification efforts. Central to these approaches is the concept of facility (arc—node) importance or criticality to system survivability. Assessments of network vulnerability can dramatically differ based on how facility importance is characterized. In this review, various approaches for assessing facility importance and network vulnerability are examined. The key differences in these approaches are the ways in which a facility's role in maintaining network operability is evaluated given arc—node disruption. Comparative results suggest significant differences exist among measures of facility importance and network performance. Furthermore, the subsequent incongruities in these measures and their implications need to be clearly understood to support interdiction risk and vulnerability assessment for critical infrastructures.},

abstract = {Evaluating network infrastructures for potential vulnerabilities is an important component of strategic planning, particularly in the context of managing and mitigating service disruptions. Many methods have been proposed to facilitate such analysis, providing different interpretations of infrastructure vulnerability. The primary approaches that have been employed for network vulnerability analysis can be broadly classified as scenario-specific, strategy-specific, simulation, and mathematical modeling methodologies. Research on network vulnerability assessment has traditionally focused on one of these methodologies without consideration of the others. This article highlights the important implications of methodology for both infrastructure planning and policy development. To better understand the theoretical and practical trade-offs associated with methodology selection, this article provides a review of these categories of analysis, examining benefits and shortcomings with regard to practical planning issues and policy interpretation.},

title={Region-based connectivity - a new paradigm for design of fault-tolerant networks}, 
year={2009}, 
pages={1-7}, 
abstract={The studies in fault-tolerance in networks mostly focus on the connectivity of the graph as the metric of fault-tolerance. If the underlying graph is k-connected, it can tolerate up to k - 1 failures. In measuring the fault tolerance in terms of connectivity, no assumption regarding the locations of the faulty nodes are made - the failed nodes may be close to each other or far from each other. In other words, the connectivity metric has no way of capturing the notion of locality of faults. However in many networks, faults may be highly localized. This is particularly true in military networks, where an enemy bomb may inflict massive but localized damage to the network. To capture the notion of locality of faults in a network, a new metric region-based connectivity (RBC) was introduced in. It was shown that RBC can achieve the same level of fault-tolerance as the metric connectivity, with much lower networking resources. The study in was restricted to single region fault model (SRFM), where faults are confined to one region only. In this paper, we extend the notion of RBC to multiple region fault model (MRFM), where faults are no longer confined to a single region. As faults in MRFM are still confined to regions, albeit multiple of them, it is different from unconstrained fault model where no constraint on locality of faults is imposed. The MRFM leads to several new concepts, such as region-disjoint paths and region cuts. We show that the classical result, the maximum number of node-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes is equal to the minimum number of nodes whose removal disconnects the pair, is no longer valid when region-disjoint paths and region cuts are considered. We prove that the problems of finding (i) the maximum number of region-disjoint paths between a pair of nodes, and (ii) minimum number of regions whose removal disconnect a pair of nodes, are both NP-complete. We provide heuristic solution to these two problems and evaluate their efficacy by compari- ng the results with optimal solutions.},

abstract={Connectivity k(G) of a network G is traditionally considered to be the primary metric for evaluation of its fault tolerance capability. However, connectivity as a metric has several limitations - e.g., it has no mechanism to distinguish between localized and random faults. Also it does not provide any information about the network state, if number of failures exceed k(G). The network state information that might be of interest in such a scenario is the size of the largest connected component. In this paper, we address both these limitations and introduce a new metric called region-based largest component size (RBLCS), that provides the largest size of the component in which the network decomposes once all the nodes of a region fail. We study the computational complexity of finding RBLCS for a given network. In addition, we study the problem of least cost design of a network with a target value of RBLCS. We prove that the optimal design problem is NP-complete and present a heuristic to solve the problem. We evaluate our heuristic by comparing its solutions with the optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that our heuristic produces near optimal solution in a fraction of time needed to find the optimal.},

abstract = {Identifying critical nodes in a graph is important to understand the structural characteristics and the connectivity properties of the network. In this paper, we focus on detecting critical nodes, or nodes whose deletion results in the minimum pair-wise connectivity among the remaining nodes. This problem, known as the critical node problem has applications in several fields including biomedicine, telecommunications, and military strategic planning. We show that the recognition version of the problem is \{NP\} -complete and derive a mathematical formulation based on integer linear programming. In addition, we propose a heuristic for the problem which exploits the combinatorial structure of the graph. The heuristic is then enhanced by the application of a local improvement method. A computational study is presented in which we apply the integer programming formulation and the heuristic to real and randomly generated data sets. For all instances tested, the heuristic is able to efficiently provide optimal solutions in a fraction of the time required by a commercial software package.},}

abstract={Society relies heavily on its networked physical infrastructure and information systems. Accurately assessing the vulnerability of these systems against disruptive events is vital for planning and risk management. Existing approaches to vulnerability assessments of large-scale systems mainly focus on investigating inhomogeneous properties of the underlying graph elements. These measures and the associated heuristic solutions are limited in evaluating the vulnerability of large-scale network topologies. Furthermore, these approaches often fail to provide performance guarantees of the proposed solutions. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability measure, pairwise connectivity, and use it to formulate network vulnerability assessment as a graph-theoretical optimization problem, referred to as -disruptor. The objective is to identify the minimum set of critical network elements, namely nodes and edges, whose removal results in a specific degradation of the network global pairwise connectivity. We prove the NP-completeness and inapproximability of this problem and propose an pseudo-approximation algorithm to computing the set of critical nodes and an pseudo-approximation algorithm for computing the set of critical edges. The results of an extensive simulation-based experiment show the feasibility of our proposed vulnerability assessment framework and the efficiency of the proposed approximation algorithms in comparison to other approaches.},

abstract={Telecommunications networks, and in particular optical WDM networks, are vulnerable to large-scale failures in their physical infrastructure, resulting from physical attacks (such as an electromagnetic pulse attack) or natural disasters (such as solar flares, earthquakes, and floods). Such events happen at specific geographical locations and disrupt specific parts of the network, but their effects cannot be determined exactly in advance. Therefore, we provide a unified framework to model network vulnerability when the event has a probabilistic nature, defined by an arbitrary probability density function. Our framework captures scenarios with a number of simultaneous attacks, when network components consist of several dependent subcomponents, and in which either a 1+1 or a 1:1 protection plan is in place. We use computational geometric tools to provide efficient algorithms to identify vulnerable points within the network under various metrics. Then, we obtain numerical results for specific backbone networks, demonstrating the applicability of our algorithms to real-world scenarios. Our novel approach allows to identify locations that require additional protection efforts (e.g., equipment shielding). Overall, the paper demonstrates that using computational geometric techniques can significantly contribute to our understanding of network resilience.},

abstract = "Network reliability analysis has received considerable attention and is thus widely studied to predict and prevent any network failure. However, most of such works presume perfectly reliable nodes. Although a few studies have considered both link and node failures, none of these methods has utilized the minimal paths or cuts, which are considered as fundamental approaches in the network reliability evaluation. An efficient method for deducing the minimal cutsets of a system subject to both link and node failures from the minimal cutsets of the system, which assumes perfect node reliability, is presented. The proposed method does not require re-enumeration of minimal cutsets for the additional consideration of the node failures. For a simple extension of such a method, the proposed approach can be embedded in any exact or approximate algorithm to account for link failures as well as node failures. As a result, the application of this method would be more realistic and valuable in practice for the reliability evaluation of networks with unreliable nodes. "

pages={143-148}, 
abstract={In an increasingly connected world, critical infrastructure systems suffer from two types of vulnerability. The first is the traditionally recognized problem of monitoring the systems for faults and failures, recognizing and analyzing data, and responding with real understanding to the problems of the system. Increasingly complex systems create the opportunity for single points of failure to cascade when inaccurate assessment of system health increases response time or leads to faulty analysis of the problems involved. A second problem involves vulnerability to cyber intrusion, in which malignant actors can mask system degradation or present false data about system status. A resilient system will protect stability, efficiency, and security. To ensure these three states, the system must react to changing conditions within the system with coordination: no one component of the system can be allowed to react to problems without real consideration of the effects of that action on other components within the system. Systems with multi-agent design typically have three layers of action, a management layer, a coordination layer, and an execution layer. A resilient multi-agent system will emphasize functions of the execution layer, which has the responsibility of initiating actions, monitoring, analyzing, and controlling its own processes, while feeding information back to the higher levels of management and coordination. The design concept of a resilient control system execution agent (ReCoSEA) grows out of these underpinnings, and through the use of computational intelligence techniques, this paper suggests an associated design methodology.},

abstract={The tradeoff between robustness and resilience is a pivotal design issue for modern industrial control systems. The trend of integrating information technologies into control system infrastructure has made resilience an important dimension of the critical infrastructure protection mission. It is desirable that systems support state awareness of threats and anomalies, and maintain acceptable levels of operation or service in the face of unanticipated or unprecedented incidents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid theoretical framework for robust and resilient control design in which the stochastic switching between structure states models unanticipated events and deterministic uncertainties in each structure represent the known range of disturbances. We propose a set of coupled optimality criteria for a holistic robust and resilient design for cyber-physical systems. We apply this method to a voltage regulator design problem for a synchronous machine with infinite bus and illustrate the solution methodology with numerical examples.},

abstract={The increasingly recognized vulnerability of industrial control systems to cyber-attacks has inspired a considerable amount of research into techniques for cyber-resilient control systems. The majority of this effort involves the application of well known information security techniques to protect system networks. These techniques are primarily concerned with the prevention of unauthorized access and the protection of data integrity. While these efforts are important to protect the control systems that operate critical infrastructure, they are never perfectly effective thus motivating a need to develop control systems that will operate successfully during a cyber attack. Little research has focused on the design of control systems with closed-loop dynamics that are resilient to cyber-attack. An understanding of the types of modifications to the system and signals that could be employed by an attacker after they have gained access to the control system and the effects of these attacks on the behavior of the control systems can guide efforts to develop attack detection and mitigation strategies. To formulate this problem, consistent mathematical definitions of concepts within resilient control need to be established to enable a mathematical analysis of the vulnerabilities and resiliencies of a particular control system design methodology and architecture. In this paper, we propose rigorous definitions for state awareness, operational normalcy, and resiliency as they relate to realtime control systems. We will also discuss some mathematical consequences that arise from the proposed definitions. The goal is to begin to develop a mathematical framework and testable conditions for resiliency that can be used to build a sound theoretical foundation for resilient control research.},

abstract={Control system networks are increasingly being connected to enterprise level networks. These connections leave critical industrial controls systems vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Most of the effort in protecting these cyber-physical systems (CPS) from attacks has been in securing the networks using information security techniques. Effort has also been applied to increasing the protection and reliability of the control system against random hardware and software failures. However, the inability of information security techniques to protect against all intrusions means that the control system must be resilient to various signal attacks for which new analysis methods need to be developed. In this paper, sensor signal attacks are analyzed for observer-based controlled systems. The threat surface for sensor signal attacks is subdivided into denial of service, finite energy, and bounded attacks. In particular, the error signals between states of attack free systems and systems subject to these attacks are quantified. Optimal sensor and actuator signal attacks for the finite and infinite horizon linear quadratic (LQ) control in terms of maximizing the corresponding cost functions are computed. The closed-loop systems under optimal signal attacks are provided. Finally, an illustrative numerical example using a power generation network is provided together with distributed LQ controllers.},

abstract={The implementation of automated regulatory control has been around since the middle of the last century through analog means. It has allowed engineers to operate the plant more consistently by focusing on overall operations and settings instead of individual monitoring of local instruments (inside and outside of a control room). A similar approach is proposed for cyber security, where current border-protection designs have been inherited from information technology developments that lack consideration of the high-reliability, high consequence nature of industrial control systems. Instead of an independent development, however, an integrated approach is taken to develop a holistic understanding of performance. This performance takes shape inside a multi-agent design, which provides a notional context to model highly decentralized and complex industrial process control systems, the nervous system of critical infrastructure. The resulting strategy will provide a framework for researching solutions to security and unrecognized interdependency concerns with industrial control systems.},

abstract={The increasing share of distributed energy resources and renewable energy in power systems results in a highly variable and less controllable energy production. Therefore, in order to ensure stability and to reduce the infrastructure and operation cost of the power grid, flexible and controllable demand is needed. The research area of demand side management is still very much in flux and several options are being presented which can all be used to manage loads in order to achieve a flexible and more responsive demand. These different control schemes are developed with different organization of the power sector in mind and thus can differ significantly in their architecture, their integration into the various markets, their integration into distribution network operation and several other aspects. This paper proposes a classification of load control policies for demand side management in smart buildings, based on external behavior: direct, indirect, transactional and autonomous control; internal operation: decision support system scope, control strategy, failure handling and architecture. This classification assists in providing an overview of the control schemes as well as different ways of representing a building.},

The agents in each platoon are interconnected through their own communication network while only the platoon leaders are connected to global system level leader network. It is assumed that all agents are identical and are linear time invariant. For consensus control, we assume a two stage protocol: an intra-platoon protocol for platoon consensus, and an inter-platoon protocol for global system-wide consensus. The intra-platoon control is based on output information received from agents within the platoon while the inter-platoon control uses only output information of platoon leaders. We show that the system of multi-agent systems arrives at a collective consensus in the sense that each platoon arrives its own platoon consensus and at the same time all platoons collectively achieve global system-wide consensus. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the methodology.},

This paper proposes resilient control design guidelines for industrial systems that can be modeled as networked multiagent consensus systems subject to disturbances or noise. We give a general analysis of multiagent consensus networks in the presence of different disturbances from the input-to-output stability point of view. Using a nonsingular linear transformation, some necessary and sufficient results are established for disturbed multiagent consensus networks by taking advantage of the input-to-state stability theory, based on which the disturbance rejection performance is analyzed in three cases separated by the spaces of disturbances and state disagreements between agents. It is shown that the linear matrix inequality technique can be adopted to determine the optimal disturbance rejection indexes for all the three cases. In addition, two illustrative numerical examples are given to demonstrate the derived consensus results for different types of directed graphs and subject to different classes of disturbances.},

abstract={This work proposes a novel metric to characterize the resilience of stochastic cyber-physical systems to attacks and faults. We consider a single-input single-output plant regulated by a control law based on the estimate of a Kalman filter. We allow for the presence of an attacker able to hijack and replace the control signal. The objective of the attacker is to maximize the estimation error of the Kalman filter - which in turn quantifies the degradation of the control performance - by tampering with the control input, while remaining undetected. We introduce a notion of ε-stealthiness to quantify the difficulty to detect an attack when an arbitrary detection algorithm is implemented by the controller. For a desired value of ε-stealthiness, we quantify the largest estimation error that an attacker can induce, and we analytically characterize an optimal attack strategy. Because our bounds are independent of the detection mechanism implemented by the controller, our information-theoretic analysis characterizes fundamental security limitations of stochastic cyber-physical systems.},

Examples of cyberphysical systems include sensor networks, industrial automation systems, and critical infrastructures such as transportation networks, power generation and distribution networks, water and gas distribution networks, and advanced manufacturing systems. The integration of cybertechnologies with physical processes increases system efficiencies and, at the same time, introduces vulnerabilities that undermine the reliability of critical infrastructures. As recently highlighted by the Maroochy water breach in March 2000 [1], multiple recent power blackouts in Brazil [2], the SQL Slammer worm attack on the Davis-Besse nuclear plant in January 2003 [3], the StuxNet computer worm in June 2010 [4], and various industrial security incidents [5], cyberphysical systems are prone to failures and attacks on their physical infrastructure and cyberattacks on their data management and communication layer [6], [7].},

abstract={This paper considers control and estimation problems where the sensor signals and the actuator signals are transmitted to various subsystems over a network. In contrast to traditional control and estimation problems, here the observation and control packets may be lost or delayed. The unreliability of the underlying communication network is modeled stochastically by assigning probabilities to the successful transmission of packets. This requires a novel theory which generalizes classical control/estimation paradigms. The paper offers the foundations of such a novel theory. The central contribution is to characterize the impact of the network reliability on the performance of the feedback loop. Specifically, it is shown that for network protocols where successful transmissions of packets is acknowledged at the receiver (e.g., TCP-like protocols), there exists a critical threshold of network reliability (i.e., critical probabilities for the successful delivery of packets), below which the optimal controller fails to stabilize the system. Further, for these protocols, the separation principle holds and the optimal LQG controller is a linear function of the estimated state. In stark contrast, it is shown that when there is no acknowledgment of successful delivery of control packets (e.g., UDP-like protocols), the LQG optimal controller is in general nonlinear. Consequently, the separation principle does not hold in this circumstance},

pages={90-104},
abstract={This paper addresses the problem of ensuring trustworthy computation in a linear consensus network. A solution to this problem is relevant for several tasks in multi-agent systems including motion coordination, clock synchronization, and cooperative estimation. In a linear consensus network, we allow for the presence of misbehaving agents, whose behavior deviate from the nominal consensus evolution. We model misbehaviors as unknown and unmeasurable inputs affecting the network, and we cast the misbehavior detection and identification problem into an unknown-input system theoretic framework. We consider two extreme cases of misbehaving agents, namely faulty (non-colluding) and malicious (Byzantine) agents. First, we characterize the set of inputs that allow misbehaving agents to affect the consensus network while remaining undetected and/or unidentified from certain observing agents. Second, we provide worst-case bounds for the number of concurrent faulty or malicious agents that can be detected and identified. Precisely, the consensus network needs to be 2k+1 (resp. k+1) connected for k malicious (resp. faulty) agents to be generi------------%%%%%cally detectable and identifiable by every well behaving agent. Third, we quantify the effect of undetectable inputs on the final consensus value. Fourth, we design three algorithms to detect and identify misbehaving agents. The first and the second algorithm apply fault detection techniques, and affords complete detection and identification if global knowledge of the network is available to each agent, at a high computational cost. The third algorithm is designed to exploit the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, and provides local detection and identification of misbehaving agents whose behavior deviates more than a threshold, which is quantified in terms of the interconnection structure.},

The electric power system, the transportation system, and generally any computer or network system are examples of large scale systems for which external (cyber) attacks have become an important threat. We consider the case of linear networks, and we model a cyber attack as an exogenous input that compromises the behavior of a set of components. We exploit two distributed methods that rely on two different sets of assumptions to achieve detection and identification. The first method takes advantage of the presence in the network of weakly interconnected subparts, it requires limited knowledge of the network model, and it affords local detection and identification of misbehaving components whose behavior deviates more than a threshold. The second method relies on the presence of a set of trustworthy leaders with better computation and communication capabilities. Only relying on a partial knowledge of the network model, the leaders cooperatively detect and identify misbehaving components.},

This prototypical control problem is relevant in network security applications. The objective is for each node to detect and isolate the misbehaving nodes using only the information flow adopted by standard consensus protocols. We focus on the single misbehaving node problem. Our technical approach is based on the theory of unknown input observability. First, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the misbehavior to be observable and for the identity of the faulty node to be detectable. Second, we design a distributed unknown input estimator, and we characterize its convergence rate in the "equal-neighbor" model and in the general case.

Using the framework of differential games, we design a dynamical optimization framework that produces strategies that are robust to adversarial intervention. For linear dynamics, we show that optimal strategies make connection to potential-theory. In the virus spread case, we show that optimal controllers exhibit multiple switches. Moreover, we establish a connection between game theory and dynamical descriptions of network epidemics, which provides insights into decision making in infected networks. Finally, we present initial building blocks for network controllability using a limited number of controls.},

volume={59},

pages={1454-1467},
abstract={The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

pages={2038-2049},
abstract={In this paper, we study the problem of reaching a consensus among all the agents in the networked control systems (NCS) in the presence of misbehaving agents. A reputation-based resilient distributed control algorithm is first proposed for the leader-follower consensus network. The proposed algorithm embeds a resilience mechanism that includes four phases (detection, mitigation, identification, and update), into the control process in a distributed manner. At each phase, every agent only uses local and one-hop neighbors' information to identify and isolate the misbehaving agents, and even compensate their effect on the system. We then extend the proposed algorithm to the leaderless consensus network by introducing and adding two recovery schemes (rollback and excitation recovery) into the current framework to guarantee the accurate convergence of the well-behaving agents in NCS. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through case studies in multirobot formation control and wireless sensor networks.},

abstract={We develop a graph-theoretic characterization of controllability and observability of linear systems over finite fields. Specifically, we show that a linear system will be structurally controllable and observable over a finite field if the graph of the system satisfies certain properties, and the size of the field is sufficiently large. We also provide graph-theoretic upper bounds on the controllability and observability indices for structured linear systems (over arbitrary fields). We then use our analysis to design nearest-neighbor rules for multi-agent systems where the state of each agent is constrained to lie in a finite set. We view the discrete states of each agent as elements of a finite field, and employ a linear iterative strategy whereby at each time-step, each agent updates its state to be a linear combination (over the finite field) of its own state and the states of its neighbors. Using our results on structural controllability and observability, we show how a set of leader agents can use this strategy to place all agents into any desired state (within the finite set), and how a set of sink agents can recover the set of initial values held by all of the agents.},

abstract={This paper concerns the study of observability in consensus networks modeled with strongly regular graphs or distance regular graphs. We first give a Kalman-like simple algebraic criterion for observability in distance regular graphs. This criterion consists in evaluating the rank of a matrix built with the components of the Bose-Mesner algebra associated with the considered graph. Then, we define some bipartite graphs that capture the observability properties of the graph to be studied. In particular, we show that necessary and sufficient observability conditions are given by the nullity of the so-called local bipartite observability graph (respectively, the local unfolded bipartite observability graph) for strongly regular graphs (respectively, the distance regular graphs). When the nullity cannot be derived directly from the structure of these bipartite graphs, the rank of the associated bi-adjacency matrix enables evaluating observability. Eventually, as a byproduct of the main results, we show that nonobservability can be stated just by comparing the valency of the graph to be studied with a bound computed from the number of vertices of the graph and its diameter. Similarly, nonobservability can also be stated by evaluating the size of the maximum matching in the aforementioned bipartite graphs.},

abstract={In this paper, the controllability problem for multi-agent systems is investigated. In particular, the case of a single leader under a fixed topology is considered. In contrast to the existing literature on this topic, we assume that the graph is weighted and we may freely assign the weights. Under this setup, the system is controllable if one may find a set of weights so as to satisfy the classical controllability rank condition. It turns out that this controllability notation purely depends on the topology of the communication scheme, and the multi-agent system is controllable if and only if the graph is connected. Moreover, some simulation results and numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach.},

The property of structural controllability is reduced to a property of the graph of the pair ( A,b ). To do this, the basic concept of a "cactus" and the related concept of a "precactus" are introduced. The main result of this paper states that the pair ( A,b ) is structurally controllable if an only if the graph of ( A,b ) is "spanned by a cactus."

We determine that there is a polynomial number of non-trivial positions for such a figure that need to be considered and, subsequently, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for the problem.

abstract={This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms.

title={Consensus problems in networks of agents with switching topology and time-delays},
year={2004},
volume={49},

pages={1520-1533},
abstract={In this paper, we discuss consensus problems for networks of dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. We analyze three cases: 1) directed networks with fixed topology; 2) directed networks with switching topology; and 3) undirected networks with communication time-delays and fixed topology. We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and provide a convergence analysis in all three cases. We establish a direct connection between the algebraic connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear consensus protocol. This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected graphs to digraphs. It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus problems. We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols. A disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics. We proposed a simple disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network with switching topology. A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks with directed information flow. We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and control theory. Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.},

abstract={We introduce the decentralized fault detection filter which is the structure that results from merging decentralized estimation theory with a game theoretic fault detection filter. A decentralized approach may be the ideal way to health monitor large-scale systems for faults, since it decomposes the problem down into (potentially smaller) “local” problems and then blends the “local” results into a “global” result that describes the health of the entire systems. The benefits of such an approach include added fault tolerance and easy scalability. An example given at the end of the paper demonstrates the use of this filter for a platoon of cars proposed for advanced vehicle control systems},

In this paper we address two aspects of this problem which allow direct application of numerical analysis work. Essentially, there are two ideas which are discussed 1) If the closed loop eigenvalues are separated, one should avoid a closed loop system whose eigenvector matrix is nearly singular. 2) If there are to be repeated or clustered eigenvalues, one should not deal directly with the eigenvectors of the cluster; instead one should use an orthogonal basis which approximates the corresponding closed loop (A+BF) invariant subspace.},

abstract={The ability to maintain state awareness in the face of unexpected and unmodeled errors and threats is a defining feature of a resilient control system. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of distributed fault detection and isolation (FDI) in large networked systems with uncertain system models. The linear networked system is composed of interconnected subsystems and may be represented as a graph. The subsystems are represented by nodes, while the edges correspond to the interconnections between subsystems. Considering faults that may occur on the interconnections and subsystems, as our first contribution, we propose a distributed scheme to jointly detect and isolate faults occurring in nodes and edges of the system. As our second contribution, we analyze the behavior of the proposed scheme under model uncertainties caused by the addition or removal of edges. Additionally, we propose a novel distributed FDI scheme based on local models and measurements that is resilient to changes outside of the local subsystem and achieves FDI. Our third contribution addresses the complexity reduction of the distributed FDI method, by characterizing the minimum amount of model information and measurements needed to achieve FDI and by reducing the number of monitoring nodes. The proposed methods can be fused to design a scalable and resilient distributed FDI architecture that achieves local FDI despite unknown changes outside the local subsystem. The proposed approach is illustrated by numerical experiments on the IEEE 118-bus power network benchmark.},

Furthermore, we discuss how to reduce the number of observer nodes while maintaining the coverage of the entire network. The results are applied to two classes of networked control 	systems: a network running the consensus protocol and a power network defined by the linearized swing equation.

Two classes of distributed control 		systems of large practical relevance are considered.

Moreover, the importance of certain network measurements is shown.

abstract={Given a network of interconnected nodes, each with its own value (such as a measurement, position, vote, or other data), we develop a distributed strategy that enables some or all of the nodes to calculate any arbitrary function of the node values, despite the actions of malicious nodes in the network. Our scheme assumes a broadcast model of communication (where all nodes transmit the same value to all of their neighbors) and utilizes a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own previous value and those of its neighbors. We consider a node to be malicious or faulty if, instead of following the predefined linear strategy, it updates its value arbitrarily at each time-step (perhaps conspiring with other malicious nodes in the process). We show that the topology of the network completely characterizes the resilience of linear iterative strategies to this kind of malicious behavior. First, when the network contains 2f or fewer vertex-disjoint paths from some node xj to another node xi , we provide an explicit strategy for f malicious nodes to follow in order to prevent node xi from receiving any information about xj's value. Next, if node xi has at least 2f+1 vertex-disjoint paths from every other (non-neighboring) node, we show that xi is guaranteed to be able to calculate any arbitrary function of all node values when the number of malicious nodes is f or less. Furthermore, we show that this function can be calculated after running the linear iteration for a finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the number of nodes in the network) with almost any set of weights (i.e., for all weights except for a set of measure zero).},

Previous work from the authors has focused on how to distinguish the behavior of a misbehaving agent in a completely distributed way, by developing a solution where agents act as local monitors of their neighbors and use locally sensed information as well as data received from other monitors at a particular time. In this work, we improve the system detection capability by allowing monitors to use information collected at different instants and thus realizing a dynamic state observer that is valid for any system in the considered class.

	Abstract = {Two points in a polygon are called visible if the straight line segment between them lies entirely inside the polygon. The art gallery problemfor a polygon P is to find a minimum set of points G in P such that every point of P is visible fiom some point of G. This problem has been shown to be NP-hard by Lee and Lin. However, Chvatal showed that the number of points of G will never exceed [n/3] for a simple polygon of n sides. This latter result is referred to as the art gallery theorem. Many variations on the art gallery problem have been studied, and work in this area has accelerated after the publication of the monograph of 0 'Rourke, which deals exclusively with this topic.
This paper provides an introduction to art gallery theorems, and surveys the recent results of thefield. The emphasis is on the results rather than the techniques. Inaddition, this paper examines several new problems that have the same geometric flavor as art gallery problems.},

	Abstract = {This thesis focuses on the development of the model-based fault detection and isolation /fault detection and diagnosis (FDI/FDD) techniques using the unknown input observer (UIO) methodology. Using the UI de-coupling philosophy to tackle the robustness issue, a set of novel fault estimation (FE)-oriented UIO approaches are developed based on the classical residual generation-oriented UIO approach considering the time derivative characteristics of various faults. The main developments proposed are:
 Implement the residual-based UIO design on a high fidelity commercial aircraft benchmark model to detect and isolate the elevator sensor runaway fault. The FDI design performance is validated using a functional engineering simulation (FES) system environment provided through the activity of an EU FP7 project Advanced Fault Diagnosis for Safer Flight Guidance and Control (ADDSAFE).
 Propose a linear time-invariant (LTI) model-based robust fast adaptive fault estimator (RFAFE) with UI de-coupling to estimate the aircraft elevator oscillatory faults considered as actuator faults.
 Propose a UI-proportional integral observer (UI-PIO) to estimate actuator multiplicative faults based on an LTI model with UI de-coupling and with added 𝐻∞ optimisation to reduce the effects of the sensor noise. This is applied to an example on a hydraulic leakage fault (multiplicative fault) in a wind turbine pitch actuator system, assuming that the first derivative of the fault is zero.
 Develop an UI--proportional multiple integral observer (UI-PMIO) to estimate the system states and faults simultaneously with the UI acting on the system states. The UI-PMIO leads to a relaxed condition of requiring that the first time derivative of the fault is zero instead of requiring that the finite time fault derivative is zero or bounded.
 Propose a novel actuator fault and state estimation methodology, the UI--proportional multiple integral and derivative observer (UI-PMIDO), inspired by both of the RFAFE and UI-PMIO designs. This leads to an observer with the comprehensive feature of estimating faults with bounded finite time derivatives and ensuring fast FE tracking response.
 Extend the UI-PMIDO theory based on LTI modelling to a linear parameter varying (LPV) model approach for FE design. A nonlinear two-link manipulator example is used to illustrate the power of this method.},

The field of observer based fault diagnosis for complex control systems has become an important topic of research in the control community over the last three decades. Recently, special attention has been paid to the problem of robust fault diagnosis for linear and nonlinear uncertain systems. Many proposecl fault diagnosis approaches are based on robiist state observer techniques, which can provide the right estimation of system states iinder the existence of a large class of model uncertainties aricle disturbances, known as unknown inputs. It is notecl that robust state estimation reqtiires strong restrictive existence conditions, which confines its practical application. On the other hancl. it is iinnecessary to estimate al1 states for the objective of fault cfiagnosis. This thesis is ati attempt to accornplish robust fault diagnosis iiricler weaker existence conditions through the tlevelopment of the unknown input, and slicling rnotle func- tionai observer theory. The proposed functiond observers can estimate a fiinction of system states by decoupling the effect of the unknown inputs.

The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of unknown input func- tional observer (UIFO)for linear systems are obtained with the aid of Loop Transfer Recovery (LTR)technique. A constructive design procedure is given. The problem of estimating the unknown input is also addressed. Two kinds of reduced-order unknown input estimators iising only measured outputs are presented. They extend full-order input estimators design in the existing literature and have advantage of working for certain class of non-minimum phase systems.

Under a UIFO framework, the unknown input decoupled residual generator is de- veloped, and the remaining freedom for fault diagnosis observer design, after unknown input decoupling, is completely revealed. A fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed, which combines unknown input decoupling theory and the Beard-Jones detection FiIter, or input estimator. This algorithm offers maximum residual dimension and is therefore more applicable than existing robust fault diagnosis schemes which are based on unknown input observer. Representation of a sensor fault, as a mathemati- cal equivalent of an actuator fault, is further developecl. The structurec! properties of the au,smentecl system for sensor fault detection are providecl.

	Abstract = {Data mining of massive data sets is transforming the way we think about crisis response, marketing, entertainment, cybersecurity and national intelligence. Collections of documents, images, videos, and networks are being thought of not merely as bit strings to be stored, indexed, and retrieved, but as potential sources of discovery and knowledge, requiring sophisticated analysis techniques that go far beyond classical indexing and keyword counting, aiming to find relational and semantic interpretations of the phenomena underlying the data. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis examines the frontier of analyzing massive amounts of data, whether in a static database or streaming through a system. Data at that scale--terabytes and petabytes--is increasingly common in science (e.g., particle physics, remote sensing, genomics), Internet commerce, business analytics, national security, communications, and elsewhere. The tools that work to infer knowledge from data at smaller scales do not necessarily work, or work well, at such massive scale. New tools, skills, and approaches are necessary, and this report identifies many of them, plus promising research directions to explore. Frontiers in Massive Data Analysis discusses pitfalls in trying to infer knowledge from massive data, and it characterizes seven major classes of computation that are common in the analysis of massive data. Overall, this report illustrates the cross-disciplinary knowledge--from computer science, statistics, machine learning, and application disciplines--that must be brought to bear to make useful inferences from massive data.},

year={2015},
volume={103},
number={9},
pages={1449-1477},
abstract={In various disciplines, information about the same phenomenon can be acquired from different types of detectors, at different conditions, in multiple experiments or subjects, among others. We use the term “modality” for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or “challenges,” are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: “why we need data fusion” and “how we perform it.” The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, “diversity” is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},
